# Smooth_Soccer
Implement RRT Smooth algorithm from scratch that will pilot a robot past defenders to kick a ball into a goal using aruco tag detections

My code is the better_soccer module inside the pathing package

There are two modules that I used to standardize movement that I wrote

The midterm is in there too!
